ðŸ‘‹ Howdy, I'm iiPython.

---
I'm a full-stack developer in [Python](https://python.org), [Lua](https://lua.org), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and more.  
I primarily focus on CLIs and socket-based applications, although I also [work with websites](https://iipython.cf) and [discord bots](https://github.com/ii-Python/Prism-v3).

As of right now, these are my primary projects:
+ [eDOS](https://github.com/ii-Python/eDOS) (Terminal-based Operating System)
+ [Roblox Status Live](https://github.com/RobloxStatusLive) (Status Monitor)
+ [Plasma](https://github.com/plasma-chat/plasma) (Chatting Protocol)


You can contact me either via Discord ([iiPython#0768](https://discord.com/users/633185043774177280)), or by email ([ben@iipython.cf](mailto:ben@iipython.cf)).  
Also consider checking out [DmmD](https://github.com/Dm12332131mD); he works in JS and makes some pretty impressive things.
