ðŸ‘‹ Howdy, I'm iiPython.

---
I'm a full-stack developer in [Python](https://python.org), [Lua](https://lua.org), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and more.  
I primarily focus on CLI/TUIs and socket-based applications, although I also [work with websites](https://iipython.cf) and [discord bots](https://github.com/ii-Python/Prism-v3).

Here are some of my current projects (July 27):
+ [iiPython Networking OS](https://github.com/iiPythonNetworking/os) (OS designed for networking-based processes)
+ [Nitrogen](https://github.com/iiPythonx/nitrogen) (Python module for web applications)
+ [eDOS](https://github.com/iiPythonx/eDOS) (Terminal-based Operating System)

Taking a break from most programming as of June 2022;  
I'll update this README when school starts and I get more project ideas/motivation.
