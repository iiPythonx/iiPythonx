## ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!
---

Welcome to my github profile, the place where most of my projects are published.

---
#### ðŸ§  Known languages
I know Python, Node.js, HTML/CSS/JS, Lua, and a bit of Java.
Primarily I tend to work with Python, with websites (HTML/CSS) being my close second.

Some frameworks I also know would include:
  - Bootstrap
  - & Flask

#### ðŸ“˜ Languages I'm Learning
Trying to learn Java/C slowly but definitely surely.

I'm also learning assembly for some lower level operations (and perhaps might even create an OS?).


---
#### ðŸ’¬ Contact me
For the fastest response time, it's recommended to message me on discord at `iiPython#0768`.

Just in case, you can always shoot me an email at `ben@iipython.cf`.
